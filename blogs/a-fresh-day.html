        <div class="blog-body">There is this feeling of reprieve at the beginning of a new day. I'm not sure how many of you are morning people, but I'd like to think that I am one. There's this untapped potential in the wee hours of the morning before most of the world has woken up which feels refreshing. It just gradually gets chipped away during the rest of the day.</div>
        <div class="blog-body">I've always been a little scatter-brained when it comes to tasks, as often I find myself working on something only to be distracted by another task. This pops up a lot whenever I'm working on my games. I'll be working on a gameplay feature, then suddenly encounter a bug or two which will take my immediate attention regardless of their actual importance.</div>
        <div class="blog-body">Before I know it, I'll have spent a few hours working on something that might not even be relevant to my primary tasks. Because of this, I've developed a habit of creating "To-Do" lists early in the morning. As soon as I wake up, I grab my phone to write down a checklist of tasks that I will need to accomplish that day. And you know what? It helps sort of "gamify" my errands. The more things I get done, the more satisfying it gets to gradually chip away at that list.</div>
        <div class="blog-body">Perhaps you could try something like that as well.</div>
