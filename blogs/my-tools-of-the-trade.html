            For those of you who are new to digital art, a common question that people ask is: Should I get a regular or a display tablet?
            <br>
            <br>
            <h1>The Hardware</h1>
            I started using digital tablets a little later in life. Prior to that, it was mostly just little sketches in my notebooks or the occasional sketchbook. It wasn't until my Freshman year of college that I decided to pony up the $40 for a basic drawing tablet, which was a pretty big purchase for me.
            <br>
            <br>
            The tablet I got was a Turcom TS-6608 drawing tablet. It had an active area of 8x6 inches with around 2048 levels of pressure sensitivity. At the risk of sounding like an ad, it was pretty decent for a beginner's tablet. Though I will admit that there were issues with the driver software. The product line had been bought out by another company called Huion, and so I had to fish through several support emails before they were able to provide me with the proper drivers to actually use the thing.
            <br>

            <br>
            This was primarily a budget/space limitation. I was living in a dorm at the time with a small desk available to me, working with a cheap laptop to get me through that first year. The <em>main</em> drawback to a regular drawing tablet is that there is a steep learning curve for those who are transitioning from a traditional drawing background.
            <br>
            <br>
            With drawing tablets, newcomers tend to experience a disconnect between having to look up at a screen and their drawing hand. Since you can't look directly at your hands while drawing, it requires you to train your hand-eye coordination until you get used to it. For me, it took around a year before I could draw comfortably without constantly fighting against my hand. It definitely feels strange the first time you use it.
            <br>
            <br>
            I think one of the main reasons why is because the tablet's active area represents the entirety of your monitor. Most people's initial response to moving the mouse around using a tablet would be to treat it like a laptop trackpad, dragging in the same spot to move the cursor relative to its current position. However, you have to keep in mind that if you move your hand to the corner of the tablet, your cursor will appearing at the corner of your display, regardless of how large your monitor or your tablet actually is.
            <br>
            <br>
            It can definitely take a while, so don't feel frustrated if it doesn't click for you overnight. I used this tablet for a few years before eventually upgrading to a display tablet by XP-Pen.
            <br>

            <br>
            <br>
            This display tablet was quite a bit of a game changer for me, since it finally allowed me to <em>see</em> what I was drawing on. The disconnect was solved, although that's not to say that it's a perfect solution. There is still a slight delay between your pen and the cursor on the display. It's minute, but sometimes you can see it if you look close enough. Though newer models of this tablet seem to have mostly fixed it by updating the screen to a laminated model.
            <br>
            <br>
            Since the display tablet didn't come with a stand, I also purchased a tablet stand made by a company called Parblo. This helped my back from hurting as I was leaning over my desk far too often and for far too long while working on my comics.

            Sometime near the beginning of 2020, I saved up some money and also purchased an iPad and an Apple Pencil so that I could draw digitally on the go. That was the year I was planning on doing more traveling, and so I figured a portable tablet would be useful. Ha. Ahahah. Ahahahahaha.
            <br>

            <br>
            In any case, the iPad proved to be a pretty useful tool, especially when we started returning to the office a couple of years later.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h1>The Software</h1>
            I'm going to be forthright with you: I don't like Photoshop for illustrations. I know that it's an industry standard, but it has never felt good to draw for me. When I first started with digital illustration, I turned to a free program called <b>Paint Tool SAI</b>, which seems to be a pretty common program for beginners. It's pretty straightforward with its toolset and it's free, which is definitely the main reason I picked it up.
            <br>
            <br>
            There were some other programs that I toyed around with at the time, primarily <b>Autodesk Sketchbook</b> and <b>Krita</b>, which is an open-source painting program that has made some pretty big strides over the years. All of these programs are free and available if you search it up, although I think Sketchbook has gone through some changes on that department in recent years. The desktop version should still be free, though.
            <br>
            <br>
            However, the primary drawing program I use these days is called <b>Clip Studio Paint Pro</b> . I bought it around 2017 when I began to work on my <em>Landfall</em> comic more regularly. It was an offshoot of an older program called Manga Studio, but gradually developed into its own thing. I gotta' say, this software is the best drawing program I've ever used.
            <br>
            <br>
            I work primarily with manga-inspired lineart, so most of my drawings are black and white affairs. Clip Studio Paint (CSP) offers just a ton of different tools catered to that sort of workflow. It has different types of rulers for perspective or symmetry, built-in halftones, word bubbles and panel layouts.
            <br>
            <br>
            Another neat feature of CSP is the variety of different brushes and pens that it comes with. You can also customize them to your liking, saving them under different groups for future use. CSP also has a marketplace in which users can upload/sell their brushes and materials, although there are tons that are available for free. Personally, I use a customized triangle brush for most of my lineart, and then a goauche brush set if I'm feeling particularly painterly (This isn't often the case). 
            <br>
            <br>
            Another noteable tool I use comes in the form of <b>PureRef</b>, which is a free (though donations are appreciated) program for organizing reference photos. It's really simple and easy to use. You just copy and paste an image directly onto the canvas and <em>boom</em> you have a freeform reference sheet to put whatever you want in.
            <br>
            <br>
            Regardless of how you find yourself as a digital art beginner, just remember that it will take time, and no amount of fancy software will give you the skill you need without practice.
